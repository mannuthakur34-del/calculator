# calculator
This project is a responsive basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It supports standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The layout closely mimics the real-world look of a handheld calculator using a grid-based button layout and clean user interface design.
